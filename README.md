# Decentralised YouTube

A decentralized platform for user-generated content, where any user can upload videos, store them on IPFS, and mint them as NFTs on the blockchain. This project ensures true decentralization by allowing content creators to fully own their videos.

## Features

- Upload videos from any connected Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
- Videos are stored on IPFS for decentralized hosting.
- Each video is minted as an NFT, with the uploader as the owner.
- Video listing displays all uploaded videos along with their owners.
- Provides user feedback during upload (e.g., "Uploading..." state).
